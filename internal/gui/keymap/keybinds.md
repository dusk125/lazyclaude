When collapsed, only the project name is shown.

## new_session

`n` creates a session in the project directory.
`N` creates a session with a directory input pre-filled with the current working directory.
The session runs inside a lazyclaude-managed tmux window.

## delete_session

Delete the selected Claude Code session.
The tmux window associated with the session is also killed.
A confirmation prompt appears before deletion.

All keyboard input is forwarded directly to Claude Code.
Use `Ctrl+\` to detach and return to the session list.

## launch_lazygit

`Enter` or `r` switches to a full-screen view where
the Claude Code output fills the entire terminal.

The PM session coordinates multiple Claude Code workers,
dispatching tasks and reviewing results via the MCP server.

## connect_remote

Opens a hostname input dialog. On Enter, establishes an SSH tunnel
to the daemon, sets up tmux socket forwarding, and registers the
remote sessions in the session list.

## send_key

`1` sends accept (Ctrl+Y), `2` sends allow (Ctrl+A), `3` sends reject (Ctrl+N).
Useful for responding to tool permission prompts without attaching.

## purge_orphans

Remove orphaned sessions that no longer have a running tmux window.
This cleans up stale session entries from the session list.

## popup_accept

Accept the tool execution request shown in the notification popup.
`Ctrl+Y` or `1` sends acceptance to the Claude Code session.

## popup_allow

Allow the tool for the remainder of this Claude Code session.
`Ctrl+A` or `2` grants permission without future prompts for this tool type.

## popup_reject

`Ctrl+N` or `3` denies the tool from running.

## popup_accept_all

Accept all pending tool notifications at once.
`Y` processes all visible notification popups with acceptance.

## popup_jump

Jump the cursor to the session that produced the focused notification.
`f` moves the cursor to the source session in the session list.
The popup auto-hides because the cursor is now on the session it belongs to.

`Ctrl+V` activates scroll mode, allowing you to browse the tmux pane's scrollback history.
Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to scroll line by line, `Ctrl+U`/`Ctrl+D` for half-page jumps,
and `g`/`G` to jump to the top or bottom of the scrollback buffer.
Press `v` to toggle visual line selection, then `y` to copy the selected text to the clipboard.
`Esc` or `q` exits scroll mode and returns to normal full-screen key forwarding.

## fullscreen_forward

Keys forwarded directly to the Claude Code session in full-screen mode.
Enter, Esc, and arrow keys are passed through to Claude Code.
All other keys (including typed text) are also forwarded via the input editor.

## search

`/` opens an inline search bar at the bottom of the active panel.
Type to filter items in real time (case-insensitive substring match).
`Enter` confirms the filter and keeps the filtered view.
`Esc` cancels the search and restores the original list.

## dismiss_error

`Esc` clears the error so the normal session preview is shown again.
Errors also clear automatically when you move the cursor to another session.
